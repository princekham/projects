## Parts that I will need

- vacuum chamber
- vacuum pump
- chilling tank
- gas stove
- gas stove controller
- pressure gauge
- valve
- information 
  -  how much pressure do i need?
     - Vacuum frying is a process that is carried out under pressures well below atmospheric levels (below 6.65â€‰kPa whichis 0.9499972 psi).
     - The process of immersing food partially or completely in oil during part or all of the cooking period at atmospheric pressure (760 mm Hg or 101.3 kPa absolute) is called deep-fat frying or deep frying (101.3 kgPa = 14.692323 psi)(from source 1)
     -  a standard American pressure cooker, the pressure reaches 1 atm or 15 psi (pounds per square inch) above standard atmospheric pressure*, or 2 atm, which is typically the maximum pressure limit on most cookers
     -  ref source 2, it fried at 66 cmhg = 1.27623 psi 
     -  source 3 just use not much thick steel, I think.
     -  source 4 shows more functions
  - heat resistant glass
  - how to make sealing for rotation rod
  - water boiling points - https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/water-evacuation-pressure-temperature-d_1686.html
    - I think to get around 99 degree C, we have to apply 14 psi
- To do list
  - the size of vacuum machine that I need
  - figure out the cooling system for the sucked air
  -
